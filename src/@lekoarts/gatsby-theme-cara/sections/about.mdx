# About

Hi, my name is Jean-Charles and I'm currently living in Phuket island, Thailand.

I'm building websites since last century. Web development has been part of my daily routine for two decades even though I specialized in digital marketing.

I worked for big brands and I built several online businesses from scratch. I am able to create clean and functional websites and applications. 

I am competent in my frontend, backend, and design abilities. I enjoy developing pleasant user experiences and seizing new skills.
