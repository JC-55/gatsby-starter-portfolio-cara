# About

Hi, my name is Jean-Charles. I'm building websites since last century and I'm currently living in Phuket island, Thailand.

Web development has been part of my daily routine for two decades. I worked for big brands and I built several online businesses from scratch. I am able to create clean and functional websites and applications. I am competent in my frontend, backend, and design abilities.
